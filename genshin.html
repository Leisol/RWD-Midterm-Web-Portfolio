    <p>This page is all about what I love about genshin.</p>

    <h3>What is Genshin?</h3>
    <p>Genshin is an open-world game that supports cooperative gaming.
        It allows players to help other players but forbids any violence
        between them. There are a lot of things in this game and let me tell you,
        the lore is just *chef's kiss*. <em>This is not sponsored in any way. I am just a very fond player of the game.</em>

        This was when me and my friends decided to do a bucket list. We found a good spot in Liyue
        to slide down. We did it for more than 10 times until we decided to move to another one and
        finally cross it off from the bucket list.

       After the hill slide we decided to go on ahead and find the unusual hilichurl. We went around between
       the 2 nations: Mondstadt and Liyue in order to find him. And when we did...well, yeah.

        Ah yes, this was taken on the 2.8 patch of the game. The 2nd rerun of the Golden Apple Archipelago and
        my dearest Kazuha's 1st rerun after a year. This patch has been very memorable for me as it gave so much
        backstory to each character involved, especially the secretive Kazuha. The limited-time archipelago had its
        additions, the isles of the different characters involved.
