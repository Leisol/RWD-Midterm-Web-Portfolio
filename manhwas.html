    <p><em>
        I kind of have gotten into the Villaines heroine manhwas, and this is one of my favourites. 
        I have been up to date with this manhwa as it has really followed the "Villainess" role. But
        she really has a good heart, she was just betrayed by her step-sister in her past life which made
        her who she is in the present time.

        This manhwa, I just can't explain how well written the story is, how the plot began brewing, how the
        conflict rose and how it was resolved, and the angst, I can't explain just how much this manhwa as
        brough angst in my heart. Imagine getting reincarnated and seeing your family living without you anymore.

        Bringing in the classics, we have Who Made Me A Princess. This revolved around a princess who got reincarnated
        after being beheaded by her father who favoured the "acutal" princess. Athy, who returned time tried to stayed out
        of her father's way and just live in peace, but fate had so much more in store for her. This is just aaaaa >///<

    <p><em>
        Imagine being betrayed by your whole family, with no one by your side just because of a random girl claiming to be the
        actual gifted princess. But she was given another chance to live a life that is full of love and also unearth the hidden
        secret of her previous family. Another must read!

    <p><em>
        Just a warning, this manhwa has a lot of real-life trauma in it and that is what makes this manhwa special. It show just how
        trauma and abuse can affect someone. But the manhwa gave the heroine someone to lean on, to trust. And in the male lead's
        perspective, the Female lead is beautiful, flawless, and perfect.
