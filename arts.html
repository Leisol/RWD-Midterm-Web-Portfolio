    <h1>Some of my Drawings:</h1>

    <img src="img/sketches.jpg" width="1000">
    <p>These are sketches of Ayaka, Venti, and Ayato. Characters from Genshin Impact.
        I began sketching these because they are some of the favourite characters
        of me and my friends.
    </p>
    <br>

    <img src="img/dream-drawing.png" width="400">
    <p>This is my ongoing drawing of Lumine of Childe, one of my favourite pair in Genshin.</p>

    <br>
    <img src="img/ei-drawing.png" width="400">
    <p>This is one of my OC's whose color palette is inspired by none other than,, The Raiden Shogun.</p>
    
    <br>
    <img src="img/sketch1.png" width="600">
    <p>This is actually a  character sketch I designed for the animation competition that me and
        my classmates joined. He was supposed to be a overworked, sleep-deprived office worker.
        But it was eventually changed as the animaton genre plan changed.
